## üöÄ Install

In order to add this block, head to your project directory in your terminal and follow the steps in [Pre-requisites](#-pre-requisites) and [Usage](#-usage) sections below.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You need to have the [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) installed on your deployment machine before installing this package.

## üìä Metrics

The below metrics displays approximate values associated with deploying and using this block.

Metric | Value
------ | ------
**Type** | Architecture
**Installation Time** | Less than 1 minute
**Audience** | Developers, Solutions Architects
**Requirements** | [aws-sam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html),[Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## üéí Pre-requisites

 - Ensure you have installed the [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) on your deployment machine.
 - Make sure that you have a [Sagemaker Algorithm Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-mkt-create-algo.html) or a [Sagemaker Algorithm on AWS Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-marketplace.html) already created in the AWS region in which you will execute the step-function associated with this block. A Sagemaker Algorithm Resource requires model training and inference docker image URIs. These images can be either [pre-built](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html) or custom. You can create a [Sagemaker Algorithm Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-mkt-create-algo.html) taking [H2O GBM Algorithm Resource](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-h2o-blog/tree/master/h2o-gbm-algorithm-resource) project as a reference.
 - Ensure your [Sagemaker Hyperparameter Tuning Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html) is provisioned with enough service limits (e.g model training, managed spot training, max parallel training job limits).
 - Ensure you have an [S3 VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) or a [VPC NAT device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat.html) associated to the subnets defined for model tuning process.
 
## üî∞ Description

This block is to build the infrastucture required to implement an Amazon Sagemaker Model Hyperparameter Tuning Process. It creates a Step Function called `ModelTuningStateMachine` which natively integrates with Amazon Sagemaker, AWS Lambda & Amazon SNS entities that are created. This block can be used both as a standalone project or a dependency for other projects which will involves an Amazon Sagemaker Model Hyperparameter Tuning at any stage.
