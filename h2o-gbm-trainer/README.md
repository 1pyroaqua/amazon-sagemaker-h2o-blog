## üéí Pre-requisites

 - You should have Administrator rights in your PC if you are a Windows user. If you are a Linux or MacOS user, your used should be a member of ‚Äúdocker‚Äù group.
 - If you are Windows user, [AWS Tools for Powershell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-set-up-windows.html) will be automatically installed to your PC by the deployment windows batch scripts (Minimum PowerShell version is 5.1).

## üöÄ Install

In order to add this block, head to your project directory in your terminal and add it using NPM.
You can build and push the Docker image created to Amazon ECR by executing the command below.

#### Linux/MacOs:

```sh
npm run deploy --region=<region>
```

#### Windows:

```sh
npm run deploy-win --region=<region>
```


## üìä Metrics

The below metrics displays approximate values associated with deploying and using this block.

Metric | Value
------ | ------
**Type** | Resource
**Compilation Time** | Depends on your network bandwith
**Deployment Time** | Depends on your network bandwith
**Audience** | Developers, Solutions Architects, Data Scientists
**Requirements** | [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/),[Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## üîñ Features

 - Option to create [Model ObJect, Optimized](https://www.h2o.ai/community/glossary/model-object-optimized-mojo) (MOJO) and [Binary Model](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/save-and-load-model.html#binary-models) artifacts trained with [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai/) machine learning framework.
 - A [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) build file which provides the dependencies that the image requires.

## üî∞ Description

This block is to create a Model Training Docker image for [H2O Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) Estimator](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiHhOn5l4nrAhViTRUIHT51BjsQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.h2o.ai%2Fh2o%2Flatest-stable%2Fh2o-docs%2Fdata-science%2Fgbm.html&usg=AOvVaw1kTu8JkgeTw_lasTS927vl) for Amazon Sagemaker.

> This project supports Python 3.x and H2O 3.30.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Building the Docker Image

In order to build the [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) file associated with this library, you will need to have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your development or build machine. You can then navigate to the project base directory and execute the command below.

Linux/MacOs:

```sh
npm run build --build_mode=aws
```

#### Windows:

```sh
npm run build-win --build_mode=aws
```


## üîñ Testing in Local

You can build and test the Docker image created in your local PC by executing the command below.

#### Linux/MacOs:

```sh
npm run test-local
```

#### Windows:

```sh
npm run test-local-win
```

Please observe how a H2O GBM Model is trained, validated and exported as a MOJO artifact:

## üõ† Usage

This Docker Image is created to support [Bring Your Own Algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms.html) approach for Amazon Sagemaker Model Training process. 

You can use this algorithm as a standalone ECR resource or an input for other projects such [Sagemaker Model Tuner](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-h2o-blog/tree/master/sagemaker-model-tuner) or [Sagemaker Model Tuner with Endpoint Deployment](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-h2o-blog/tree/master/sagemaker-model-tuner-with-endpoint-deployment).
